# Scrape-News-Fin-express
A simple script to get articles, date, and title in a csv file. Implemented in Google Colab.

It started with a simple task, where a friend needed some help in extracting some articles for a research project. She got a script which ran perfectly for her, but didn't worked for me. So, I spent a couple of hours, using Claude 2.1 and ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo to troubleshoot. I started with GPT but was going nowhere. I switched to Claude, helped a little manually, amde progress, but exhausted Claude Beta limit. Next evening I again dedicated a couple of hours and got it working. So posting here. Learned a little bit about extracting data from websites. Let me know if it works for you. Hopefully, will update a more elaborate version in the future.
